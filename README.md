> A file with the .docx extension is one that Microsoft Word normally saves in XML format. It includes XML stylesheets, which are analogous to.xslt, to give .doc additional power and styling. It is the brand-new document format that Microsoft Word 2007 launched, and it is incompatible with Word versions that don't support XML (older than 2007). All documents are saved by default as .docx files with Word 2007 and later. Because they use an outdated version of Microsoft Word, some people can't open Word documents with the .docx extension.
